# ChemicalInventoryProject

## Introduction
During my time at the Tech Academy, I worked with a group of peers to make a full-stack web-app using Django that could connect to a database and had full CRUD functionality. We had opportunities to work on front-end and back-end stories, with varying degrees of difficulty. Each of us worked individually on our separate applications, but the apps were all integrated into the same legacy codebase. This project was a great opportunity to learn about the MVC design philopsphy and work as part of a team using AGILE methodolgy. The topic I chose was a chemical invetory application a lab manager might use to keep track of their lab's in-house materials. The app also connects to an API and includes a web-scrapper. Over the two-week sprint I utilized project management skills that I can use in my futre projects.
